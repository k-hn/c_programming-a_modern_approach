(a)
Output if DEBUG is defined:
value of i: 1
value of j: 2
value of k: 3
value of i + j: 3
value of 2 * i + j - k: 1

(b)
Output if DEBUG is not defined:

(c)
In (a) DEBUG is defined, and consequently the definition of PRINT_DEBUG() which outputs data.
If DEBUG is not defined then the non-output version of PRINT_DEBUG() is defined.

(d)
It is needed else the calls to PRINT_DEBUG() will not output anything since there is a check
in debug.h to determine which version of PRINT_DEBUG() is defined.
