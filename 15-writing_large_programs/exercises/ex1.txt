Advantages:
1. Time is saved on compilation when only a few files out of the lot are edited.
2. Assuming the files are separated logically, making changes are likely to be easier.

Disadvantages:
1. Could result in many files being created
2. Splitting programs, small ones especially, could make it a bit more challenging to follow the
   logic of the program.
