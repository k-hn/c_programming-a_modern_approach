| Type   | Size(bytes) |
|--------|-------------|
| char   | 1           |
| int    | 4           |
| double | 8           |

```c
union {
  double a;			/* 8 bytes */
  struct {
    char b[4];			/* 4 bytes */
    double c;			/* 8 bytes */
    int d;			/* 4 bytes */
  } e;				/* struct: 16 bytes */
  char f[4];			/* 4 bytes */
} u;
```

Space allocated: 16 bytes i.e the size of biggest member which is the struct p
